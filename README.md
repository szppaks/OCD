# OCD
OCD very fast point cloud outlier filter

Octree based "radius-outlier-like" point cloud filter
Based on  'Fast Radius Outlier Filter Variant for Large Point Clouds by PÃ©ter Szutor and Marianna Zichar'

How to use:
Transfer the points to a numpy block.
The numpy array should be passed to the filter, which will return the points that are not outliers. (Caution: it does not keep the original order)

How to install
Use the following modules, these must be piped in first:
numpy
numba

An example of how to use it:<br><i>
import ocdfilter<br>
import open3d as o3d<br>
import numpy as np<br>
pcd=o3d.io.read_point_cloud('samplepointcloud.pcd',format='pcd')<br>
ppoints=np.asarray(pcd.points)<br>
occ=ocdfilter.obfilter(ppoints,0.5,9,12)<br>
filteredpcd=o3d.geometry.PointCloud(o3d.utility.Vector3dVector(occ))   <br>
o3d.io.write_point_cloud('filteredpcd.pcd', filteredpcd)<br>
